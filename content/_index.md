      - title: Welcome to the group
        content: We are a team of scientists & engineers that studies how our cells interact with each other and with their physical microenvironment, particularly in the context of **fibrosis**---'scarring' of tissue that contributes to a vast range of human diseases.

      - title: Systems mechanobiology & <br>regenerative engineering
        content: We take a **systems approach** to investigate mechanisms that drive tissue regeneration and fibrotic remodeling by integrating (i) molecular biology, (ii)tissue and biomaterials engineering, and (iii) data science.
