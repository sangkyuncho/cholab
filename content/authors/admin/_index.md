**Sangkyun ('Sang') Cho, PhD,** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering with a secondary appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. He is a Core Faculty member of the Institute for NanoBioTechnology (INBT) and the Center for Microphysiological Systems (MPS). His lab brings together tissue/biomaterials engineering, systems biology, and regenerative medicine to tackle fibrosis---a key driver of disease and aging across nearly all of our solid organs. He is particularly interested in developing precision 'mechanotherapies' for treating cardiovascular fibrosis and heart failure.

Sang is the recipient of multiple honors and awards, including the NIH F32 Postdoctoral Fellowship (2020), the _Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology_ 'Paper of the Year' Award (2021), the American Heart Association Career Development Award (2023), and the NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award (2023).

Sang grew up in four different countries in four very distinct parts of the world---South Korea, the US, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland---so he loves traveling and exploring new cultures. Outside the lab, he enjoys running (mainly to offset his love for good food).
