**Myoung Hwan (Hwan) Kim, PhD**, is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. He is a biomedical engineer specializing in biofabrication and tissue engineering, integrating engineering and biology to develop advanced biofabrication strategies and engineer physiologically and functionally relevant human tissue models. His research focuses on applications in tissue regeneration, organ development, disease modeling, and mechanotransduction, with the goal of overcoming key challenges in fabricating engineered 3D human tissues that closely recapitulate native structure and function.

Hwan was born and raised in South Korea. Outside of the lab, he enjoys bodybuilding, cooking, and traveling.
